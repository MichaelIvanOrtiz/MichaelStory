I woke up on the beach one day, and I saw something wonderful. I said to myself, "Michael, look how beautiful this is." It's hard to describe, but I will try.

Driving down the beach, sand flying everywhere, it was him; Elon Musk. As he flies by in his cherry red Tesla Roadster he waves my way and continues on his joyride.
