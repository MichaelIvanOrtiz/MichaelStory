I woke up on the beach one day, and I saw something wonderful. I said to myself, "Michael, look how beautiful this is." It's hard to describe, but I will try.

Driving down the beach, sand flying everywhere, it was him; Elon Musk. As he flies by in his cherry red Tesla Roadster he waves my way and continues on his joyride.

At this moment, I saw a beautiful blonde girl basking in the sun. Oh, how beautiful she is. Her blonde hair shimmered in the sun, her hair was blown up by the breeze,the lithe and graceful posture makes me unable to move my eyes. 
I said Hey girl, do you want a ride? but she hopped on that cherry red Tesla and said good bye

So I sat at the beach, and admired the sands instead. I prefered the look of the seafoam.
